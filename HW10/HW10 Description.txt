HW10 Description
Make sure to implement this program using C++ STL.

Example of execution
%run_bst
a 3 kimdool
a 2 JisungPark
a 5 KoreaKorea
a 2 global(print out "2 is already in the tree")
a 9 university
d 3
d 7 (print out "7 is not in the tree")
p (should print out the nodes (key, value))
d 5
p (should print out the nodes (key, value))
q

the format of each line should be command(key, value)
coomand: a character
key: an integer
value: a string


Commands
1) a : add
2) d : delete
3) p : print (use inorder traversal)

4) q : terminate the program execution
Output
(key1, value1)
(key2, value2)
(key3, value3)...

- Use inorder traversal to print out the (key,value) pairs.

* Upon entering duplicate key value, print out: "<duplicate_val> is already in the tree"
* Upon deletion, if the key and value being delete is not in the BST, print the following error message: "<nonexistent value> is not in the tree"
* Entering "p" (print) should print out the nodes
