HW4 Description

Read matrices and apply '+' (addition), 'x' (matrix multiplication) and 'transpose' operations.

Each operation should be implemented as a function (do NOT use static arrays).

The return value should be a double pointer. ( ex.) int ** ptr;)

float **add_matrix(float** a, int ah, int aw, float** b, int bh, int bw)
float **mul_matrix(float** a, int ah, int aw, float** b, int bh, int bw)
float **transpose_matrix(float** a, int ah, int aw)(or you can implement with 1D array)

*The multiplication means "matrix multiplication".

Output

1) "Matrix dimension mismatch" when given matrices whose rows and corresponding number of columns do not match (i.e. 3x4 and 5x6)
2) the dimension of the output matrix and the matrix elements in order.
(i.e. The output is:
3 3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9)

Steps)
1) Read two files, each of which has a size in the first line followed by elements.
2) Check the matrix sizes (matrix dimension: w x h) for operations.
3) Print out the output matrix after the size - the format style should be the same as that of the input.
